- 👋 Hi, I’m @Tommy-Hu
- 👀 I’m interested in computer science, pixel art, music composition/production, and game development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ to get familiar with lower level programming languages. I know pretty much everything about C#, as I have been using C# for over 7 years.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on game development. Take a look at my survival game project on my Instagram!
